# Fahrzeughandel

A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz + Grub Academy. The project simulates a small vehicle dealership where vehicles can be registered and assigned test drives. Test drives can result in vehicle sales, depending on a randomized condition, and sold vehicles are removed from the dealershipâ€™s list.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

To run the Console App program directly, launch `"Fahrzeughandel.exe"` located in `"bin/Debug/net7.0"`.

**Note: german language used.**
